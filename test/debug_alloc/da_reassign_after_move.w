//! expect-debug-alloc: leak count=0

// #614 (drop-elaboration "Dead" arm). `r` owns a heap allocation freed in drop.
// `take(r)` consumes r1 (frees r1.ptr); `r = new_resource()` must NOT free r1.ptr
// again — it was already moved out. Before the fix, the drop-before-overwrite at
// the reassignment freed the moved-out pointer a second time → DOUBLE FREE. The
// allocator is the oracle: a double-free fails this test; leak count must be 0.
