// D29 #750 scaffolding: user type declarations shadow prelude-closure type
// names. Each shadowed name below is also defined (with different fields and
// impls) inside the std prelude closure; user sites must bind the user decl,
// std internals must keep their own (regex.w's literals, string.w's
// StringBuilder construction, rc.w's Box use), and trait verdicts must not
// conflate tiers: the user CString takes Copy although std's has Drop, and
// std's Regex keeps its vtable-forced clone.
