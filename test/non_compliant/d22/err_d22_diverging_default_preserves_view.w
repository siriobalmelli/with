//! D22-NON-COMPLIANT
//! owner-stage: 4
//! required-verdict: check-fail at `map.clear()`
//! exact-type: `view` is `&i32`; the diverging default does not anchor ownership
//! expected-diagnostic: cannot mutate `map` while `view` is a live view into it
//! origin-set: `view` has `{map}`
//! drop-behavior: rejection precedes codegen; the map remains the sole owner
