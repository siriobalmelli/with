//! D22-NON-COMPLIANT
//! owner-stage: 4
//! required-verdict: check-fail at `value = 124`
//! exact-type: explicit `Option[&i32]` unwrap gives `view: &i32`
//! expected-diagnostic: cannot mutate `value` while `view` is a live view into it
//! origin-set: construction and unwrap preserve `{value}` without a collection producer
//! drop-behavior: rejection precedes codegen; no owner is duplicated
