//! D22-NON-COMPLIANT
//! owner-stage: 7
//! required-verdict: comptime, native, and C-emitted execution all produce `117`
//! exact-type: comptime lookup is `Option[&i32]`; declared return context materializes owned `i32`
//! expected-diagnostic: none in any semantic engine or backend
//! origin-set: the returned contextual Copy has `{}`
//! drop-behavior: comptime storage is finalized once; native and C map storage drop once
