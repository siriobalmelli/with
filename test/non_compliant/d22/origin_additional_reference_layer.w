//! D22-NON-COMPLIANT
//! owner-stage: 4
//! required-verdict: check-fail at `value = 130`
//! exact-type: matching `&(i32, &i32)` binds `nested: &&i32`
//! expected-diagnostic: cannot mutate `value` while `nested` is a live view into it
//! origin-set: `nested` preserves `{value}` through both shared-reference layers
//! drop-behavior: rejection precedes codegen; no owner is duplicated
